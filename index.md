## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pipo.jpg">

I am a Phd candidate at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris. I am currently writing my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

I am a labor and macro economist with research interests in firm dynamics, labor economics and the evaluation of public policies.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Research Papers

1. "**Aggregate Uncertainty and the Micro-Dynamics of Firms.**" - Updating draft.

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    Using French firm-level micro-data, I find evidence that firms with low expected growth are more sensitive to aggregate shocks. I interpret these findings using a frictional model offirm growth. The estimated model suggests that this heterogeneous sensitivity can have important consequences for the elasticity of aggregate net job creation to the aggregate state.

2. "**Income Tax Progressivity as a Stabilizer of Labor Income Risk**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - 2nd draft coming soon ([Poster](poster_sam_2018_Dalvit_Pascal.pdf)).

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    We show that decreasing income tax progressivity causes an increase in the overall volatility of income in the economy. Our estimated search-and-matching model of the labour market is able to
    reproduce several stylized facts on the cyclical behaviour of income risk.

3. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**", with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research) - 2nd draft coming soon.

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    Does increased female leadership decrease gender wage gaps within firms? Exploiting a recent French
    reform on board membership composition we find a statistically significant effect only at the very
    top of the organisation.

4. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**", (2019), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). [Click here](Network_Beliefs_4th_draft_31_05_2019.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397092)].

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    This paper shows how friendship shapes beliefs and political opinion. We make use of a unique
    natural experiment that randomly assigns new freshmen into groups in a college that produces most
    of Franceâ€™s top politicians. We find strong, robust effects of friendship on differences in beliefs.
