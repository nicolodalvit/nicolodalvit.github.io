## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pipo.jpg">

I am a Phd candidate at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris. I am currently writing my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

My research interests are in labor economics, firm dynamics and the evaluation of public policies.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Work in Progress

1. "**Firm Dynamics and individual Earnings: Evidence from French Data**".

2. "**Labor Taxation and Income Shocks over the Cycle**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - (Working paper coming soon).

    <p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>:
    We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to the cyclical behavior of the distribution of individual income shocks along the business cycle. We build a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We solve the model using perturbation techniques developed in Reiter (2009). We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1980-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different payroll tax schedules can alter the cyclicality of income risk for different types of workers.</p>

3. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**", with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research).

    <p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>:
    Within-firm factors are known to play a major role in wage inequality. This paper documents the role of hierarchies in gender wage and employment gaps using administrative French data. First, we document the extent and evolution of gender wage gaps across pre-defined layers of hierarchy within firms over time. We find that gender wage and representation gaps are larger in upper layers of hierarchy, even as they narrow over time. Second, we exploit a policy on corporate board quotas in France to study the impact of an increase in female leadership on gender wage and employment outcomes within firms. We find that a rise in the share of women on corporate boards narrows the gender wage gap only for top layers of hierarchy, but not for lower layers. We also observe that greater female corporate board membership increases the share of women working part-time in lower layers of hierarchy, at the expense of full-time work. The opposite effect holds for upper layers. The results suggest that, at least in the short term, female corporate board members improve the relative wages of women in close hierarchical proximity. They may also be able to affect change on flexi-work culture for the firm as a whole. However, due to the nonlinear returns to hours worked for upper layer professions, only lower layer women shift into part-time work.</p>


### Working Papers

1. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**", (2015), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). 2nd draft coming soon.
