## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pipo.jpg">

I am a Phd candidate at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris. I am currently writing my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

My research interests are labor economics, the role of firms in the labor market and the evaluation of public policies.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Work in Progress

1. "**Firm Dynamics and individual Earnings: Evidence from French Data**".

2. "**Labor Taxation and Income Shocks over the Cycle**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - (Working paper coming soon).

    <p align="justify"> <i>Abstract</i>:
    We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to the cyclical behavior of the distribution of individual income shocks along the business cycle. We build a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We solve the model using perturbation techniques developed in Reiter (2009). We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1980-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different payroll tax schedules can alter the cyclicality of income risk for different types of workers.</p>

3. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**", with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research).

### Working Papers

1. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**", (2015), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). 2nd draft to be finished.
