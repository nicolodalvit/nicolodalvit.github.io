## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pipo.jpg">

I am a Phd candidate at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris. I am currently writing my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

My research interests are in labor economics, firm dynamics and the evaluation of public policies.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Work in Progress

1. "**Firms, Workers and the Dynamics of Earnings: Evidence from French Data.**".

2. "**Labor Taxation and Income Shocks over the Cycle**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - Working paper coming soon ([Poster](poster_sam_2018_Dalvit_Pascal.pdf)).

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    > We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to the cyclical behavior of the distribution of individual income shocks along the business cycle. We build a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We solve the model using perturbation techniques developed in Reiter (2009). We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1980-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different payroll tax schedules can alter the cyclicality of income risk for different types of workers.
