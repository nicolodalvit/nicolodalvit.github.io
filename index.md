## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="logo.jpg">

I am a labor and macro economist with research interests in firm dynamics and labor economics.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from Sciences Po under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

I will be joining the World Bank in September 2020.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Research Papers

1. "**Aggregate Uncertainty and the Micro-Dynamics of Firms.**". [Click here](Paper_Dynamics.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3591987)]

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
Using firm level micro-data, I find evidence that firms with lower growth prospects are more sensitive to aggregate shocks. I interpret these findings using a model of demand accumulation and endogenous entry and exit decisions, which I then estimate on French data. The resulting cyclical dynamics of firms provide an explanation for the observed counter-cyclical dispersion in firms' growth rates. They suggest that cyclical dispersion is the result of a pre-existing and persistent characteristic of the firm and caution against its use as a proxy for time-varying uncertainty. The estimated negative correlation between a firm's sensitivity to aggregate shocks and its expected future growth rate is shown to have important consequences for the cyclical characteristics of entering and exiting firms. The quantitative model suggests that this compositional effect is sizeable and equivalent to around 10.5% of the drop in aggregate employment between 2008 and 2009.

2. "**Income Tax Progressivity as a Stabilizer of Labor Income Risk**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - Draft available upon request.

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    In this article we use Italian administrative data to study the role that a progressive
    income tax can play in redistributing cyclical risk from low to high wage workers and
    reduce the volatility of aggregate employment. We do this by developing and estimating a frictional model of the labor market with heterogeneous workers, aggregate
    shocks and a non-linear tax schedule. Our results show that eliminating income tax
    progressivity in Italy while maintaining the tax revenue fixed would come at the expense of the majority of workers. The current system of marginal tax rates is effective
    at reallocating cyclical income risk from low to high wage workers and reduces aggregate employment volatility by 18.5% compared to a counter-factual flat rate system.

3. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**", with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research) - Draft available upon request.

    Does increased female leadership decrease gender wage gaps within firms? Exploiting a recent French
    reform on board membership composition we find a statistically significant effect only at the very
    top of the organisation.

4. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**", (2019), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). [Click here](Network_Beliefs_4th_draft_31_05_2019.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397092)].

    This paper shows how friendship shapes beliefs and political opinion. We make use of a unique
    natural experiment that randomly assigns new freshmen into groups in a college that produces most
    of Franceâ€™s top politicians. We find strong, robust effects of friendship on differences in beliefs.
