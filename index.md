## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pipo.jpg">

I am a Phd candidate at the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris. I am currently writing my thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Robin](https://sites.google.com/site/jmarcrobin/).

My research interests are in labor economics, firm dynamics and the evaluation of public policies.

You can download my [CV from here](CV.pdf).

## Research

### Work in Progress

1. "**Firms, Workers and the Dynamics of Earnings: Evidence from French Data.**".

2. "**Labor Taxation and Income Shocks over the Cycle**", with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - Working paper coming soon ([Poster](poster_sam_2018_Dalvit_Pascal.pdf)).

    <p align="justify">
     We develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the contribution of different payroll tax schedules to the cyclical behavior of the distribution of individual income shocks along the business cycle. We build a dynamic search-and-matching model of the labor market featuring heterogeneous workers, aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and a non-linear payroll tax schedule. We solve the model using perturbation techniques developed in Reiter (2009). We estimate the model on Italian administrative data for the period 1980-2012 and use our estimated framework to quantitatively evaluate how different      payroll tax schedules can alter the cyclicality of income risk for different types of workers.

3. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**", with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research).

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
        Does increased female leadership decrease gender wage gaps within firms? We answer this question exploiting the variation in board membership gender composition induced by a recent French reform. Preliminary evidence shows significance effects on wage and promotion gaps for the higher layers of a firm’s hierarchy. In contrast, we find no effect when looking at aggregate firm-level outcomes.

### Working Papers

1. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**", (2018), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). [Click here](Network.pdf).

    <p align="justify">
        We study how friendship shapes students’ political opinions in a natural experiment. We use the indicator whether two students were exogenously assigned to a
        short-term “integration group”, unrelated to scholar activities and dissolved before
        the school year, as instrumental variable for their friendship, to estimate the effect
        of friendship on pairwise political opinion outcomes in dyadic regressions. After
        six months, friendship causes a reduction of differences in opinions by one quarter
        of the mean difference. It likely works through a homophily-enforced mechanism,
        by which friendship causes politically-similar students to join political associations
        together, which reinforces their political similarity. The effect is strong among initially similar pairs, but absent in dissimilar pairs. Friendship affects opinion gaps
        by reducing divergence, therefore polarization and extremism, without forcing individuals’ views to converge. Network characteristics also matter to the friendship
    effect.
